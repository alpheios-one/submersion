# README asset generators

`import_website_shots.py` regenerates the screenshots embedded in the
top-level `README.md`: everything under `docs/assets/screenshots/readme/`.
The logo and the badges are not its concern. It resolves its paths from its
own location, so it can be run from any directory. It requires Pillow
(`pip3 install --user Pillow`).

```bash
python3 scripts/readme/import_website_shots.py
```

## Provenance

The screenshots are the same captures the website uses, so the README and
submersion.app stay visually in step. They are read from the sibling
[submersion-website](https://github.com/submersion-app/submersion-website)
repository:

```
repos/submersion-app/
├── submersion/            <- this repo
└── submersion-website/
    └── screenshots/       <- source PNGs
```

Clone the website repo next to this one, or point the script somewhere else
with an argument or the `SUBMERSION_WEBSITE` environment variable:

```bash
python3 scripts/readme/import_website_shots.py ~/some/other/screenshots
```

To refresh the README after the website gets new screenshots, pull the website
repo and re-run the script.

## What it does

Each source PNG is flattened to RGB, resized (1600px wide for the eight
showcase rows, 900px for the six gallery thumbnails) and saved as a
quality-85 progressive JPEG into `docs/assets/screenshots/readme/`. Output
names carry a numeric prefix matching the order the image appears in
`README.md`.

The macOS window captures have rounded corners that are transparent over
black. Compositing those onto a fixed matte would leave four dark nubs
visible against GitHub's light theme, so the script squares each corner off
using the nearest opaque pixel in the same row instead. See `flatten()`.

## Adding or replacing an image

Edit the `MAPPING` table in the script, re-run it, and update the
corresponding `<img>` tag in `README.md`. Keep the two in step: the script
writes exactly the filenames the README references. It never deletes
anything, but at the end of a run it lists any file in the output directory
it did not write, so an image dropped from `MAPPING` is easy to spot and
remove by hand.

Always view the output images before committing, and confirm each one shows
the screen its README caption claims.
